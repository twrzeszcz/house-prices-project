# General Info
This is a House Prices Prediction Project from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview) competition. Data preprocessing and training is done in the ** house_prices** notebook. Simple app is deployed on [Heroku](https://house-prices-prediction-serv.herokuapp.com/) where one can print single records from the test data in json format and predict house prices. Additiomally there is an interactive Streamlit app [Streamlit](https://share.streamlit.io/twrzeszcz/house-prices-project/main/streamlit/app_streamlit.py) where one can perform EDA, examine feature importances, and compare models performance.
